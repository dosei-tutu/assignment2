Pitch
1.Proposed Headline: Oat, Almond, Coconut Oh, My! Or perhaps Americans finding alternatives for milk.

2.The question I want to answer is what non-dairy milk Americans prefer. Also if Americans still drink cow’s milk or diary milk in comparison.

3.Answers I have found from research I have done is from articles with USDA data that Americans are drinking milk less. Almond milk is the most popular milk and Oat milk has now increased to the second spot. Also, it looks like milk prices are going up too but that data stop at 2019. I do know on USDA data sheet, the price do go down a bit in comparison from 2019 to 2020.

4.The data from the USDA tells me the production of milk for each month so I could compare and contrast. Interestingly enough milk production was higher in 2020 than 2019. And I saw a chart (I’m still looking for the exact numbers aside from the chart) of the USDA did showing that Americans are drinking less cow milk and it seems to correlate to the new non-diary vegan milk options. And a Morning Consult survey showed younger folks are drinking the non-diary vegan alternatives.
